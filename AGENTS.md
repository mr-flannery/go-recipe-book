- this project is written in Go and uses htmx and server-side templating for the frontend.
- avoid code duplication for util functions. use a central util module instead. check if functions exists in util module before creating a new one.
- don't add comment to code where its intent is obvious. only add comments if they add information that is not obvious from reading the code.
