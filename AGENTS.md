- this project is written in Go and uses htmx and server-side templating for the frontend.
- avoid code duplication for util functions. use a central util module instead. check if functions exists in util module before creating a new one.
- don't add comment to code where its intent is obvious. only add comments if they add information that is not obvious from reading the code. 
- DO NOT EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE ZERO-WIDTH WHITESPACE!
- database migrations filenames must use the current datetime in format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS (e.g., 20260207151814_add_feature.up.sql)
- avoid code duplication where possible and resonable. if you create a struct, and the same struct already exists, put the definition somewhere central and use it consistently instead of redefining it multiple times
- unit test functions should follow the naming convention: "TestThingUnderTest_BehavesLikeXWhenY" (e.g., TestAuthenticate_ReturnsUserWhenCredentialsAreValid, TestHashPassword_ReturnsErrorWhenPasswordIsWeak)
- the template that's under active development is editorial. ignore other templates for now when doing any changes.
- this is a personal app for the author and their friends/family. avoid marketing fluff, taglines, or sales-oriented copy. keep the UX functional and focused.
