- add a header and a navbar and stuff like that
  - the navbar exists, and there is a usercontext middleware. i still need to add the navbar and footer to all pages that require them and then need to update all template call functions to get the usercontext from the middleware so that the navbar can do it's thing
- add a footer with an impressum
- add random function
  - and put it into the header
- prevent website from being crawled once it's live
- write tests
- refactor
- deploy
  - nginx https stuff
  - buy domain
  - register domain with Maileroo
- fix the frigging css...
- tagging!!!
- list recipes that share ingredients with the current recipe
  - this would reuqire first implement some form of structured ingredient logging, i.e. instead of just using text, it would require structured inputs that is backed by some database
  - and/or this can be parsed from the freetext input
  - this might be an llm use case
  - probably rather do this at the end
- extract recipes from youtube videos or websites using llms
- add api endpoints for creating recipes
- calculate calorie information from ingredients
  - though this would need to be adjusted for ingredentis that are missing precise quantities
- add a collection feature
  - recipes can be added to collections
  - collections are owned by a user
  - a user can give other users access to said collection
