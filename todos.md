- finish properly writing the core CRUD logic
  - i.e. properly implement the create and update screen
- then add some frigging tests
- then deploy it somewhere
- implement registration logic
  - currently, there's no way to create accounts
  - it should be possible to create an account, and then the admin must activate it first
  - then the user should receive an email
  - the user must then activate their account, and only then it should be valid
  - where do I get an smtp server from do to this? this might be annoying
  - can I use my posteo account for this?
    - if possible rather use some gmail crap account
