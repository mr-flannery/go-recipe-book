- [] fix deletion logic
  - don't display delete button if recipe is not mine
- [] implement registration logic
  - currently, there's no way to create accounts
  - it should be possible to create an account, and then the admin must activate it first
  - then the user should receive an email
  - the user must then activate their account, and only then it should be valid
  - where do I get an smtp server from do to this? this might be annoying
  - can I use my posteo account for this?
    - if possible rather use some gmail crap account
