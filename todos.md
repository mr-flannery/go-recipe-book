- code reloading
  - Let's watch whether this actually works correctly now...
- write tests
- refactor
- deploy
  - nginx https stuff
  - buy domain
  - register domain with Maileroo
- fix the frigging css...
- tagging!!!
- openAPI spec + syncing
- list recipes that share ingredients with the current recipe
  - this would reuqire first implement some form of structured ingredient logging, i.e. instead of just using text, it would require structured inputs that is backed by some database
  - and/or this can be parsed from the freetext input
  - this might be an llm use case
  - probably rather do this at the end
- extract recipes from youtube videos or websites using llms
- add api endpoints for creating recipes
- calculate calorie information from ingredients
  - though this would need to be adjusted for ingredentis that are missing precise quantities
- add a collection feature
  - recipes can be added to collections
  - collections are owned by a user
  - a user can give other users access to said collection
- GDRP
  - export user info
  - delete account
